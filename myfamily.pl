1.  Make a family tree knowledgebase. Use your own family tree, or a

2.  Add rules for the following relationships: mother, father, son,
    daughter, brother, sister, uncle, cousin, second cousin once removed,
    ancestor, and descendant. Ancestor and descendant should be capable
    of going back or forward arbitrarily far. Add enough people that an
    example of each relationship is in the knowledgebase. Feel free to
    make up people if  you need to.

3.  Provide comments and use proper indenting and style - mother_of is a
    better name than mother for that predicate.

5.  How would you make an atheist version of your program? How would you
    characterize the 'beliefs' of your program before you did step 4?

An agnostic, rather than presupposing the existence of God in the knowledgebase,
might write a rule god(X) that succeeds where X is male and female and every
person (but X) in the knowledgebase is a child of X. An atheist may choose to
represent as fact that there is no God. One way they could do that is as a rule
that always fails, e.g.:

    god(_) :- !, fail.

Before adding a belief in God to the system, the system was much simpler.

7.  Add a comment answering these questions:
    - Pick two brothers. Use your program to demonstrate that
      they *are* brothers. How many answers does your query give?
      Explain.
    - In step 4 you added God. What problems did that cause?
      How did you fix them?
    - Step 4 might not accord to some student's religious beliefs.
      What does that say about the nature of truth in a Prolog
      knowledgebase?

Because I defined a brother as a male sibling and a sibling as a person who
shares a parent, there are two solutions to the following query, i.e: Kevin 
and Brian are brothers by virtue of sharing a mother and also by virtue of 
sharing a father.

    ?- brother_of(brian, kevin).
    true ;
    true ;
    false.

When I first added God to the system, everybody was siblings, so nobody was first 
cousins. I had to add a "\= god" exception, but then everybody was first_cousins,
so I added an exception to first_cousins. Then everybody was second cousins, so I 
added an exception to that rule. Any rule that relies on there being some shared 
ancestor would have to also require that the shared ancestor not be God. I also 
had to modify the parent_of God clause so God would not be His own parent, in 
order to prevent infinite recursion in ancestor_of.

Inserting God as a fact into a strictly and narrowly defined system that models
persons breaks the system because the Judeo-Christian God is not a person.
Rather, various metaphors have historically been used in certain contexts to
explain god. Those explanations may be useful in those contexts, but are not
applicable in the context of a family tree. It's not the same context; it's not
the same model. Some of the words used may be the same, but they don't mean quite
the same thing.
